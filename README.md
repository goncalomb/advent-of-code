# Advent of Code (advent-of-code)

My Advent of Code solutions in Python. 2025 was the first year that I participated.

I aim for clean, nice, and easy-to-understand solutions. This is my own code. No AI tools.

It includes a manager script to run the solutions (`aoc.py`).

```bash
# run all the solutions
./aoc.py run

# run a specific solution (year/day)
./aoc.py run 2025 12

# create a new solution file (year/day)
./aoc.py new 2025 24

# help
./aoc.py -h
```
